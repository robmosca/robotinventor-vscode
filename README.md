# VScode extension for the Robot inventor set

This is my attempt at writing a Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension to
program the LEGO® Mindstorms® Robot Inventor set in MicroPython.

**The code is incomplete at the moment and is not yet completely stable.**

From time to time the JSON API does not respond or there are other failures
for which I don't seem to be able to trace the root...
Since there is no official documentation of the API, all that I did is based
on what I could discover by experimenting with it.
I also got information from the following repositories, based on the LEGO®
Education SPIKE™️ Prime Set:
- [gpdaniels/spike-prime](https://github.com/gpdaniels/spike-prime/blob/master/specifications/stm32f413.pdf)
- [nutki/spike-tools](https://github.com/nutki/spike-tools)
- [sanjayseshan/spikeprime-tools](https://github.com/sanjayseshan/spikeprime-tools)

If anyone has any suggestion feel free to get in touch :)
