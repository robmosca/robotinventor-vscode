# robotinventor README

This is my attempt at writing a Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension to
program LEGO® Mindstorms® Robot Inventor in MicroPython.

**The code is incomplete and unstable at the moment...**

There seem to be problems with the JSON API. Sometimes I get not response,
sometimes it complains about wrong JSON format (while the request has correct
JSON format) and I don't seem to be able to crack it...

If anyone has any suggestion feel free to get in touch :)
